# MLB Game Predictor - Baseball Data Science Tools

## Author Brian Schroeder

#### The first script created was the Common_Winning_Stats_Analyzer.py

The goal of this script is to determine which categories such as a Teams Batting Average and ERA effect the outcome of the Game the most. This script has been designed
to look at data over a range of time and output what stat categoires helped the Winning team the most. This helps in creating a model for predicting the games winner 
based off of the players that are starting for the team and how the stats they lead in will give a certain team an advantage in Winning.

#### Synopsis
    This program gets the Winner for each game on a specific date and outputs the Stats they were leading in.
    The Output will be the total number of Games that category was higher for the Winning Team vs the losing team.

### By having all the categories that effected and helped the Winning Team, I was then able to created the algorith that is the most effecient in prediciting the Winning Team.
